# Phase 1 Testing Checklist

## üéÆ Game Launch Testing

### ‚úÖ Pre-Launch Verification
- [x] **Java Process Running**: Process ID 7536 detected
- [x] **Code Compilation**: No compilation errors found
- [x] **Dependencies**: All Fabric API dependencies properly configured
- [x] **Entry Points**: Main and Client entry points configured
- [x] **Resource Files**: All required files present

### üîç In-Game Testing Checklist

#### 1. Mod Loading Verification
- [ ] Check game logs for "Initializing Aethelon - The World Turtle mod"
- [ ] Verify "Registering Aethelon entity types" appears in logs
- [ ] Confirm "Registering Aethelon items" appears in logs
- [ ] Look for "Entity types registered successfully" message
- [ ] Check for any error messages or exceptions

#### 2. Creative Mode Testing
- [ ] Open Creative Mode world
- [ ] Navigate to "Spawn Eggs" creative tab
- [ ] Look for "Aethelon Spawn Egg" (should be dark green/brown)
- [ ] Verify spawn egg appears in inventory

#### 3. Entity Spawning Testing
- [ ] Use Aethelon spawn egg in water
- [ ] Verify large turtle entity appears (8x4 blocks)
- [ ] Check entity has proper model (body, head, shell, legs)
- [ ] Confirm entity swims properly in water
- [ ] Test entity health (should show large health bar)

#### 4. Entity Behavior Testing
- [ ] Verify entity moves slowly (movement speed 0.1)
- [ ] Check swimming animations work (leg movement)
- [ ] Test head rotation follows player/camera
- [ ] Confirm entity doesn't take knockback
- [ ] Verify entity can be damaged but has high HP (1000)

#### 5. Visual Testing
- [ ] Entity model renders correctly
- [ ] No missing texture warnings (purple/black checkerboard)
- [ ] Proper entity shadow (4.0f size)
- [ ] Model animations work during movement
- [ ] Entity scales properly (large turtle appearance)

#### 6. Natural Spawning Testing (Optional)
- [ ] Find deep ocean biome
- [ ] Wait for natural spawning (very rare)
- [ ] Verify entity spawns naturally in correct biome

### üêõ Common Issues to Watch For

#### Potential Problems:
- **Missing Texture**: Entity appears with purple/black checkerboard
- **Model Issues**: Entity appears as white cube or invisible
- **Registration Errors**: Spawn egg missing or crashes on use
- **Animation Problems**: Entity doesn't move legs while swimming
- **Performance Issues**: Game lag when entity is present

#### Solutions Ready:
- Texture can be added later (placeholder expected)
- Model registration verified in code
- Entity registration follows Fabric patterns
- Animation code implemented
- Entity optimized for performance

### üìä Expected Results

**‚úÖ Success Indicators:**
- Mod loads without errors
- Spawn egg appears in creative tab
- Entity spawns when using spawn egg
- Large turtle model appears
- Entity swims and moves properly
- Health bar shows high HP

**‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable Issues:**
- Missing texture (purple/black) - texture file not created yet
- No natural spawning seen - extremely rare by design
- Basic swimming behavior - advanced AI in Phase 2

**‚ùå Critical Issues:**
- Mod fails to load
- Spawn egg missing or crashes game
- Entity doesn't spawn or appears invisible
- Game crashes when entity is present

## Current Status: üïê Waiting for Minecraft to finish loading...

**Next Steps:**
1. Wait for game to fully load
2. Test spawn egg in creative mode
3. Verify entity spawning and basic behavior
4. Document any issues found
5. Proceed to Phase 2 if successful
