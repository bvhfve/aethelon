### 📋 Expected Test Results

When testing in-game, we should see:

#### ✅ Successful Indicators
1. **Mod Loading**: Console shows "Initializing Aethelon - The World Turtle mod"
2. **Registration**: Console shows entity and item registration messages
3. **Spawn Egg**: Available in Creative Mode spawn eggs tab
4. **Entity Spawning**: Large turtle entity appears when using spawn egg
5. **Model Rendering**: Turtle model with body, head, shell, and legs
6. **Swimming Behavior**: Entity moves in water with leg animations

#### ⚠️ Expected Limitations (Phase 1)
- **Texture**: May appear with placeholder/missing texture (purple/black)

### 🎮 Testing Instructions

1. **Wait for game to fully load** (may take 2-3 minutes)
2. **Create new Creative world** or load existing
3. **Open Creative inventory** and go to "Spawn Eggs" tab
4. **Look for Aethelon Spawn Egg** (dark green/brown colors)
5. **Use spawn egg in water** to spawn entity
6. **Verify large turtle appears** with proper model
7. **Test basic movement** and swimming behavior

### 📊 Phase 1 Success Criteria

**✅ PASS Criteria:**
- [x] Mod loads without errors
- [ ] Spawn egg appears in creative tab  
- [ ] Entity spawns successfully
- [ ] Model renders correctly
- [ ] Basic swimming behavior works

**Phase 1 will be considered SUCCESSFUL if:**
- Entity spawns and renders (even with placeholder texture)
- Basic swimming behavior is functional
- No critical crashes or errors occur

## Status: 🕐 Minecraft Loading - Ready for Testing
