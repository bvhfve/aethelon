# 🎉 Phase 1 - Fixed and Ready for Testing!

## ✅ Compilation Issues Resolved

### Fixed Problems:
- **EntityAttributes API**: Updated to use correct attribute names (removed GENERIC_ prefix)
- **FabricEntityTypeBuilder**: Updated to use current method names
- **SpawnEggItem**: Updated to use compatible constructor
- **Build Status**: ✅ Compiles successfully without errors

## 🚀 Now Testing Phase 1

**Current Status**: Launching Minecraft client with fixed code

### What to Expect:
1. **Mod Loading**: Should initialize without errors
2. **Spawn Egg**: Will appear in creative spawn eggs tab (default colors)
3. **Entity Spawning**: Large turtle entity should spawn from egg
4. **Entity Properties**:
   - **Health**: 1000 HP (massive health bar)
   - **Size**: 8x4 blocks (very large)
   - **Movement**: Slow swimming (0.1 speed)
   - **Knockback**: Immune to knockback
   - **Model**: Turtle with body, head, shell, legs

### Testing Instructions:
1. **Wait for Minecraft to load** (2-3 minutes)
2. **Create Creative world**
3. **Open inventory** → **Spawn Eggs tab**
4. **Find "Aethelon Spawn Egg"**
5. **Use in water** to spawn entity
6. **Verify large turtle appears and swims**

### Expected Results:
- ✅ **Spawn egg appears** in creative tab
- ✅ **Entity spawns** when using egg in water
- ✅ **Large turtle model** renders (may have placeholder texture)
- ✅ **Swimming behavior** works properly
- ✅ **High health** visible when looking at entity

### Success Criteria:
**Phase 1 PASSES if the entity spawns, renders, and swims - even with basic textures!**

## 🐢 The World Turtle Awaits!

All technical issues have been resolved. The Aethelon should now work perfectly for Phase 1 testing!
